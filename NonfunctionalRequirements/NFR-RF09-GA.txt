REQ-ID: NFR09
Description: The booking system shall be user-friendly
Type: Non-functional
Rationale: The patients must find it easy to book their appointments; otherwise they will stop using it and will be going to the clinic in person.  
Fit Criterion: When using the system for the first time, in less than 1 minute, nine out of ten patients shall be able to select their appointment slot availability for the given therapist for a given date range without resorting to the instructional guide
Originator:Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [GA] File devised from the FR09.
[CG-revised]: The rationale of the associated FR09 may be misleading, but the appointment system will not be for patients'use yet (it will be in the future, but for now, as Carol states, it will only be used by receptionists, she explicitly says " we don't want patients to make appointment by themselves"). For this reason, this requirements won't pass the quality gateway for me because the rationale and the fir criterion are not within scope. 
[MI] I do like the part about being able to use the system without resorting to the user guide, as that is a good measure of "easy to use" but perhaps there should also be some kind of time limit - afterall it would be no good if people could use it, but it took 2 days to work out how without the guide! This NFR is very similar in intention to NFR08 and possibly they should be combined using a "best of both" approach.
