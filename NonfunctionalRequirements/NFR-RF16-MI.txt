REQ-ID: NFR-RF16-MI
Description: Invoices should be produced in a timely manner.
Type: Non-functional (performance)
Rationale: Invoicing is crucial part of business operations and it's important that invoices are raised and sent as soon as practicable. 
Fit Criterion: The accounts system must be able to create the invoice within 1 hour of treatment completion.
Originator: Business Analyst
Comments: 
[MI] Initial comment: the original functional requirement crosses the product boundary as it concerns the interface of our/"the product" and the existing accounts system which actually raises the invoice. We cannot readily specify a performance requirement for the existing accounts system as that isn't in scope, but we can for an interface.
[DE] I would suggest that the 1-hour timer should start when the receptionist confirms, within the appointment product, that direct invoicing is the payment method. Otherwise, how would the system know when treatment has completed? Also, I would be interested in how you arrived at the 1-hour target. Were assumptions made about how the accounts system works? Beyond that, the fit criterion does include a quantitative measure, it can be used a input into acceptance test design and it does contribute to the project purpose.

[H.M.] : there are 2 problems with this requirement. first, the wording of the description is not consistent with other requirements (it usually should start with "The product shall"). Second, the fit criterion has been put on Accounts system, this would make the requirement out of scope as it doesn't serve the purpose of the product, hence not passing quality gateway. The criterion should be put on scope of our product, for example "the product should process its part and send these information to account system in [number #] hours". I also think 1 hour is too long for this product to process the invoice, you might be able to find benchmarks of how long similar systems take. 
=======
[CG] As you said, it's the account system's responsibility to issue the invoice and we have no power on that, I suggest modifying the description writing "billing information should be passed to the account system in a timely manner".
