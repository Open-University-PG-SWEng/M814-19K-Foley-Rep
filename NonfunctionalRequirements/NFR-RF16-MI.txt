REQ-ID: NFR-RF16-MI
Description: Invoices should be produced in a timely manner.
Type: Non-functional (performance)
Rationale: Invoicing is crucial part of business operations and it's important that invoices are raised and sent as soon as practicable. 
Fit Criterion: The accounts system must be able to create the invoice within 1 hour of treatment completion.
Originator: Business Analyst
Comments: 
[MI] Initial comment: the original functional requirement crosses the product boundary as it concerns the interface of our/"the product" and the existing accounts system which actually raises the invoice. We cannot readily specify a performance requirement for the existing accounts system as that isn't in scope, but we can for an interface.
[DE] I would suggest that the 1-hour timer should start when the receptionist confirms, within the appointment product, that direct invoicing is the payment method. Otherwise, how would the system know when treatment has completed? Also, I would be interested in how you arrived at the 1-hour target. Were assumptions made about how the accounts system works? Beyond that, the fit criterion does include a quantitative measure, it can be used a input into acceptance test design and it does contribute to the project purpose.
[CG] As you said, it's the account system's responsibility to issue the invoice and we have no power on that, I suggest modifying the description writing "billing information should be passed to the account system in a timely manner".
