REQ-ID:  HMcN-1
Description:  Payment receipt should be easily understood by the patient
Type:  11, 10 - Non-functional (usability / look and feel)
Rationale:  The payment receipt is for the Patient to keep a record of treatments and payments they have completed.  So the receipt should be easy to understand by any average person.  
Fit Criterion:  After looking at an example receipt for 10 seconds, any (untrained) person should be able to remember 90% of the information included on the receipt

Comments: [HMcN] This requirement should capture the simplicity and usability of the receipt.  The numbers arrived at for the fit criteria are speculative and more research into effective boundaries would improve the fit criteria.

[GA]: This type of non-functional requirement looks more like "usability" than "look and feel," so we could probably improve the measurability of the fit criterion. We could say "nine out of ten patients will have grasped the information after looking at the receipt for 10 seconds." The 90% you've mentioned refers to the information in the receipt, which is fine, but it may be quite difficult to quantify. Using the proposal I'm putting forward here, you could have 40 patients read the receipt for 10 seconds and then check how many of them have successfully grasped the information. If only maximum four and minimum zero patients haven't been unsuccessful, then the requirement can be accepted (acceptance test). 
[MW]: I would like to suggest that the Fit Criterion doesn't meet the quality gateway as it doesn't address the measurable element appropriately. The measure should address the product not the people reading it. The concept of memorising the data on the receipt is different than understanding the information read.  Example: Upon reading the receipt, the patient should be able to determine three key values: the payment amount, the VAT and the discount if applicable.
