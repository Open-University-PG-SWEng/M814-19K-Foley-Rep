Description: The product shall display the patient record/information for a given patient faster.
Type: Non-Functional 
Rationale: This will enable the user/receptionist to confirm that the patient is the subject of the completed treatment/new appointment booking in a much shorter time, enabling the receptionists to attend to more patients.
Fit Criterion: The user/receptionist should be able to access the patientâ€™s record/information within 3 seconds from opening the window in the appointments/treatment system. The product continues to do the same work, but a lot quicker.
