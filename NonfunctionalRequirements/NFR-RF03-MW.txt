REQ-ID: NFR-RF03-MW
Description: The product shall display the patient record/information for a given patient faster.
Type: Non-Functional 
Rationale: This will enable the user/receptionist to confirm that the patient is the subject of the completed treatment/new appointment booking in a much shorter time, enabling the receptionists to attend to more patients.
Fit Criterion: The user/receptionist should be able to access the patientâ€™s record/information within 3 seconds from opening the window in the appointments/treatment system. The product continues to do the same work, but a lot quicker.

Comments:
 [HMcN] The FC is incomplete and ambiguous in terms of the quality gateway criteria. 
 -Is 3 seconds the time it takes for the user(receptionist) to look up the patient in total, or the amount of time the database takes to return a record?  Perhaps a better wording would be "The product shall display patient information in no more than x actions, and within 3 seconds from when the user(receptionist) begins their search." -> this specifies a more concrete outcome (displays patient information) and is less solution bound in it's starting action (instead of "from opening the window").  
 -Secondly the Type requirement should include a number specifying which type of non-functional requirement this is.  The template also includes an Originator section to to improve traceability.  
 -Lastly, the final sentence (of the fit criterion) is probably not appropriate for a fit criteria - and would likely be moved to the rational or removed entirely.
