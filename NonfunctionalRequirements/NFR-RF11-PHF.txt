REQ-ID: NFR-11-PHF
Description:The product should gracefully handle concurrent booking record update attempts.
Type: Non Functional,Performance Requirement (Type 12)
Rationale:The product needs to handle the scenario where a concurrent attempt to book the same slot for a therapist is attempted. Although both clinics are not open at the same time at the moment, it is possible even at one location, for an attempt to double book a popular slot with a specific therapist if two receptionists are working in a busy period.
Fit Criterion:The product should immediately (within 1 second) inform the user that the free appointment slot has been taken, and not proceed with any part of the booking record update.
Originator:Business Analyst.
Comments: [DE] “Immediately” is non-specific rather than quantitative. You could instead say “within 1 second, the product should inform the user that the appointment slot has been taken”. Also, I’m not sure what “not proceed with any part of the booking record update” would look like. It implies (to me) that the product abruptly halts the booking process rather than directly offers an opportunity to select a different timeslot. With some clarification, the criterion could serve as input into acceptance test design. And contribute to the product purpose.
