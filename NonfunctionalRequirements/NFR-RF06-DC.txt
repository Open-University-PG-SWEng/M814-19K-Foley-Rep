REQ-ID:	NFR-RF06-DC
Description: The product shall promptly display results when searching for a therapist in the system.
Type: Non-functional - Performance (Type 12)
Rationale: For ease and efficiency of use, the system should respond to all input in a timely manner. Receptionists will be performing searches for therapists with high frequency, so any unnecessarily wasted time on this task would soon add up to a significant usability problem.
Fit Criterion: When searching for a therapist's record, the result of the search should be displayed within 2 seconds of initiating it.
Originator: Carol (Office manager)
Comments: [MI] The NFR and rationale make sense and the fit criterion is OK. 2 seconds sounds like a reasonable length of time, but how do we know it is realistic to guarantee this in all cases? Could testing prove it? Assessing feasibility may require analysis of technical capabilities and possibly negotiation with stakeholders if this is not feasible within project budget. Alternately you could specify something like 90% of responses will be within 2 seconds and 0% will take longer than 5 seconds - but again this involves some assumption on technical feasability.
