REQ-ID: NFR02
Description: The product shall locate patient records fast enough to avoid disrupting the user’s flow of activity.
Type: Performance (Type 12)
Rationale: To enable quick and efficient activities by the end-users. And to allow time savings compared to the manual process
Fit Criterion: The product shall locate 90% of patient records within 1 second of the user’s request. No record retrieval shall take more than 2.5 seconds
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [GA] We could probably remove the first part of the NFC and just start with the second one: "No record retrieval shall take more than 2.5 seconds"; minimum retrieval time shall be 1 second. I suggest this change because when it comes to retrieving information from a system, it should be 100%. If 10% of the information is not displayed, then there is a problem that needs immediate fixing. We may also have difficulty quantifying the information retrieved and determine the percentage. One example is when we want to find the time a patient booked his/her appointment. Whereas it is possible to quantify here, say, check whether the day, month and year are displayed, so that 1 piece of information goes with 25%, this task may be tedious and cumbersome to handle. It will just be an inaccuracy if I'm presented with the day only (Monday), when I expect Monday, 25 March 2020. Let's see what the other fellows say.
Comments: [H.M.] the first question to be asked about fit criterion is where are 1 second and 2.5 seconds coming from? Obviously the stakeholders in this case haven't asked for the product to perform an action in 1 second or 2.5 seconds. Or is there any evidence or benchmark that reading a patient profile would take this much time? Considering the speed of record retrieval depends on the technologies that have been used, I'm not aware of any evidence suggesting 1 second.
