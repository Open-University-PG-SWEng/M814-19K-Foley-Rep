REQ-ID:NFR08
Description: The product shall be easy to use
Type:No-Functional	
Rationale:so that entry of date and time range by user would be easy and fast
Fit Criterion:70% of the users should be able to select a date range in 15 seconds on their first use of the product, with maximum of 5 clicks
Originator: Carol, Office manager
Comments: [H.M.] teh quantification of the fit criterion is according to personal experience of selecting dates
[CG]: Although the fit criterion is quantitative and precise, I don't think it's abstract enough because you are suggesting the developers how to display and select date ranges with that "5 clicks maximum rule" -what if it was selectable not by clicking but by typing the date directly? I would only keep the first part of the fit criterion. I also think that the description is quite general, the product is intended only for Carol and the receptionists, I think it's valuable to add this information somewhere saying that it shall be easy to use by them (or, intuitive for their level of knowledge).
