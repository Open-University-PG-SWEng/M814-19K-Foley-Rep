REQ-ID:NFR08
Description: The product shall be easy to use
Type:No-Functional	
Rationale:so that entry of date and time range by user would be easy and fast
Fit Criterion:70% of the users should be able to select a date range in 15 seconds on their first use of the product, with no training
Originator: Carol, Office manager
Comments: [H.M.] the quantification of the fit criterion is according to personal experience of selecting dates
[CG - revised]: Although the fit criterion is quantitative and precise, it's not abstract enough because it suggests a solution to developers. 
[MI] agree with with CG about the fit criterion suggesting an implementation which is theoretically bad practise - although very difficult to avoid in reality!  I should point out that NFR-08 and NFR-09 are very similar in intention - possibly these would be combined with a best of both approach.
[LG] This is a well thought out FC, a small point that I would consider is that 70% of users is a fairly low number considering that this is a simple task - (selection of date and time). I would recommend increasing the percentage threshhold to 80 or 90%.
